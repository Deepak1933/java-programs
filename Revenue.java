Discount and Revenue
Revenue can be calculated as the selling price of the product times the quantity sold, i.e. revenue = price Ã— quantity. 
Write a program that asks the user to enter product price and quantity and then calculate the revenue. 
If the revenue is more than 5000 a discount is 10% offered. Program should display the discount and net revenue.
